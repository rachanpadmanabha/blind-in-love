// Love letter text (typewriter will reveal this)
export const LOVE_LETTER = `My love of my life,

Words cannot describe what I feel for you. So I'm writing them down anyway.

From the moment we met, something shifted. You became my favourite person to talk to, my safe place, and the one I want to share every little thing with. The ordinary days with you feel extraordinary. The hard days feel bearable because you're there.

I love the way we laugh until we cry. The way we can sit in silence and it still feels full. The way you remember the small things and forget the grudges. I love your smile, your patience, your weird sense of humour, and the way you still choose me every single day.

We've built something real—inside jokes, lazy Sundays, stupid arguments that we always get over, and a thousand tiny moments that only we know. I don't take that for granted. I want more of it. More years, more adventures, more boring errands and big dreams. More you.

So here's my question: Will you be my Valentine? (You can say yes below.)

Thank you for being you. Thank you for being mine.

Forever yours,
Rachan`
